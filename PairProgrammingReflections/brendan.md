# Pair Programing Reflections

## Identify your pair programming partner

Jack Schneiderhan

## Identify the user story you implemented alone

US07

## Describe your experience working alone on the user story. How long did it take to implement and test the story?

My experience programming along was simple given the complexity of the given user story. I was able to write and test the code without much difficulty.

## Describe your experience working with a pair programming partner on the user story. How long did it take to implement and test the story?

Working with a partner was helpful because it allowed me to quickly ask questions about the codebase without have to double check myself, it sped up dev time for sure. It took me about 12 minutes to write and test the code for US09. This was still relatively quick because the difficulty of US09 was much greater than US07.

## Describe the advantages and disadvantages for you and your teammate while pair programming. What worked well? What didn't work well?

The advantages we experienced was a smooth development experience. One disadvantage was trying to think at the same time and getting each others way.

## Would you recommend pair programming? Why or why not?

Yes, it makes programming easier and less bug prone

## Will you use pair programming on future GEDCOM user stories? Why or why not?

Probably not because the complexity and coupling of this project is relatively low. While it helped speed development up, it would still probably be faster to each work on our own user stories.
